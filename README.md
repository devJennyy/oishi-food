# Oishifood

👩‍💻 **Work in Progress**

Oishifood is a responsive ecommerce landing page for food products. I designed the hi-fi prototype for both the website and mobile app using Figma. Currently, I am in the process of integrating this design into the website with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, while also incorporating animations to enhance the user experience.
