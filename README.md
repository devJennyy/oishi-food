# Oishifood

👩‍💻 **Work in Progress**

Oishifood is a responsive e-commerce landing page for food products. I designed the hi-fi prototype for both the website and mobile app using Figma. Currently, I am integrating this design into the website with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, while incorporating animations to enhance the user experience.
