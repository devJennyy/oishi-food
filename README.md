# Oishifood

👩‍💻 **Work in Progress**

Oishifood is a fully responsive e-commerce landing page designed for food products, featuring both light and dark mode options. Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I also designed the hi-fi prototypes for both the website and mobile app using Figma. For dynamic interactions, I implemented Framer Motion for animations and integrated Embla Carousel for smooth carousel.
